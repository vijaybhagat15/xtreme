  <h1>  20 cardio exercises to do at home with minimal equipment, from beginner to advanced</h1>
   
    People do not need a lot of equipment for cardiovascular exercise. Instead, they can take
     part in cardio training at home by working their own body weight.  <br>
    
   
    <h1>Best cardio exercises to do at home </h1> <br>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Cardio_home_shutterstock747150445_Header-1024x575.jpg?w=1575" alt=""><br>

    The following are calorie-burning exercises that a person can do at home with minimal equipment. <br>
    
    These exercises can form a cardiovascular exercise program. <br>
    
    For example, a person could do each exercise for 45 seconds to 1 minute, rest for 30 seconds, and move on to the next set. <br>
    
    As their fitness levels increase, people may wish to perform these exercises in circuits. <br>
    
    To perform circuits, a person completes 30–60 second rounds of each chosen exercise in succession before resting for 30–60 seconds. They then perform the entire course again, as many times as they prefer. <br>
    
    
    <h1> Beginner</h1> <br>
    Beginner exercises do not require previous experience of physical activity or special training to perform. A person can usually increase the intensity as they advance in their cardiovascular ability.
    <br>
    Marching in place <br>
   
    Marching in place can elevate the heart rate, making this exercise a suitable choice for a warm-up or single cardio activity.
    <br>
    To increase the intensity, a person can increase the speed they march or raise the knees higher. <br>
    
    <h1>Single leg stand <br></h1>
    This exercise works the abdominal muscles. <br>
    <br>
    To perform: <br>
    
    Start with the feet together or no more than 3 inches (in) apart. <br>
    Bend the knees slightly and lift one leg 3–6 in off the floor. <br>
    Hold this position for 10–15 seconds and return the foot to the floor. <br>
    Repeat for the opposite leg. <br>
    To increase difficulty, a person can lift their leg higher off the floor or jump from one leg to the other more quickly. <br>
    
    <h1> Jogging in place <br></h1>
    Jogging in place is a simple and effective exercise to increase heart rate. This is also a suitable beginner warm-up activity. <br>
    
    To perform, bounce lightly from one foot to the other. At the same same, swing the arms from side to side. <br>
    
    Air jump rope <br></h1>
    The air jump rope requires a person to “swing” an imaginary jump rope in the air. The exercise provides an alternative to jogging in place and is suitable as part of a warm-up routine.
    <br>
    To perform, stand with the feet together and jump up and down while swinging the arms in a circular direction. <br>
    
    <h1>Dancing to music <br></h1>

    A person can turn free space into a dancefloor at home. <br>
    
    Dancing to upbeat music can burn calories, while people may find it very enjoyable as an exercise. <br>
    
    <h1>Arm circles <br></h1>
    A person can perform arm circles while sitting or standing, making them ideal for all skill levels. <br>
    
    To perform: <br>
    
    Rotate the arms in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. The movement may resemble a butterfly or backstroke. <br>
    If a person has limited mobility in their arms, they can extend their arms to their sides and draw small circles. <br>
    Jumping jacks
    Jumping jacks are a beginner cardiovascular exercise that a person can perform almost anywhere. <br>
    
    To perform: <br>
    
    Begin with the feet hip-width apart and arms down. <br>
    Raise the arms out to the sides, straight in the air while jumping out with the feet apart. <br>
    Jump back into the starting position and land softly on the balls of the feet, bringing the arms back into the body.
    A person can increase the exercise intensity by jumping higher or faster. They can also reduce intensity by performing slower or smaller jumping jacks.
    
    Supine snow angel (wipers) exercise
    A person should perform this exercise while lying down, which works the abdominal muscles, chest, and shoulders.
    
    To perform:
     <br>
    Lie on the back with the feet flat on the ground. <br>
    Tuck the pelvis slightly to place the lower back on the floor. <br>
    Extend the arms from the shoulders, slightly bending the hands toward the ears. <br>
    Slowly raise the hands toward the head to meet each other. <br>
    Lower the hands to the starting position and repeat. <br>
    Intermediate exercises <br>
    Intermediate exercises increase the intensity of the workout to get the heart pumping and the body moving. <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Squat jumps <br></h1>
    Squat jumps are a way to increase the exercise intensity while working the glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Stand with the feet hip-width apart and arms at the sides. <br>
    Bend at the knees to squat. <br>
    From the squat position, jump in the air and extend the hips until the body is straight. <br>
    Land softly on the balls of the feet, rolling backward to absorb the shock in the heels. <br>
    Repeat using different arm movements to adjust the difficulty. <br>
    Jump rope <br>
    Increase the difficulty of jumping an air rope in the beginner exercises to jumping with a real rope at home. <br>
     <br>
    A person can alternate between jumping with both feet and jumping from one foot to the other. <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Squat to front kick <br></h1>
    This exercise will challenge a person’s balance by adding a single leg kick at the peak of the squat position. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Stand with the feet hip-width apart and arms at the sides. <br>
    Bend at the knees to squat down. <br>
    Return to standing and extend one leg to perform a front kick. <br>
    Repeat the kick on the other side. <br>
    <h1>Trunk rotation <br></h1>
    The trunk rotation works the abdominal muscles while testing the cardiovascular system. <br>
     <br>
    To increase the intensity, a person can hold a heavy weight, such as a kettlebell, exercise ball, or other household items. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Stand with a heavy object at chest height with elbows to the sides. <br>
    Twist from the torso, turning to one side, then the other. <br>
    A person can also hold the arms at shoulder height and twist side to side. <br>
    “Screamer” lunges <br>
    Screamer lunges help build leg muscles while challenging the heart. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Stand with the feet hip-width apart. <br>
    Extend the right leg back to a lunge position. <br>
    Push off with the right foot to lift the right knee to hip height, jumping in the air while doing so. <br>
    Return the right foot to the starting position and repeat for 10 lunges on one side. <br>
    Repeat for the left leg. <br>
    <h1>Stair climb <br></h1>
    A person can incorporate stairs into a workout by going up and down them several times. <br>
     <br>
    Taking the stairs two at a time and increasing speed to a running pace can further challenge the cardiovascular system and leg muscles. <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Lateral shuffles <br></h1>
    This shuffling motion closely resembles a football or speed-skating warm-up. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Start on one end of a room and squat slightly. <br>
    Shuffle toward the other side of the room, with the feet meeting together before shuffling out and forward again. <br>
    Pick up speed and increase the squat depth to increase the exercise intensity. <br>
    Advanced exercises <br>
    A person can increase the intensity — referring to the rate and repetitions — of any cardio exercise to convert them into advanced movements. <br>
     <br>
    However, some exercises are also more complicated and involve transitions from floor to standing. <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Mountain climbers <br></h1>
    Mountain climbers are an advanced exercise to work the whole body, especially the lower portion. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Start in a pushup position with the right leg extended backward and the left leg near the chest with the toes on the ground. <br>
    Keeping the hands on the ground and hips level, quickly switch the positions of the legs. <br>
    Continue to alternate the legs. <br>
    Burpees <br>
    Burpees are an advanced full-body move to get the heart pumping. <br>
     <br>
    To perform: <br>
     <br>
    Start with the body in a pushup position. <br>
    Push off the balls of the feet to bring the knees into the chest and land in a squat. <br>
    Jump out of the squat, raising the hands in the air before landing softly back into the squat. <br>
    Place the hands back on the floor underneath the shoulders. <br>
    Spring the legs back to return to the starting position. <br>
    If a person wishes to increase the difficulty further, they can use a special exercise device called a Bosu ball. <br>
     <br>
